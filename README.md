A collection of frontend projects made using React.js, Material-UI and Chart.js.

🦠 covid-19-website:
A single page web application that fetches data about Covid-19 around the world from an API, and then visualises it as bubbles on each country; the larger the bubble, the more cases.

💲 crypto-website
A website that displays information about cryptocurrencies. It includes pagination, and shows the most trending cryptocurrencies at that point in time. Each cryptocurrency has it's own webpage, where is gives a description of the cryptocurrency and a line graph with an adjustable time period, showing the cryptocurrency's market value overtime.

😂 meme-generator
My first React project. It fetches URLs of memes from an API, and then allows the user to input text to make the final meme!

📒 text-editor
This is more of a full-stack project, with WebSockets being created between the React frontend and Express backend. Each document has a unique ID, and can be edited in real-time with the help of Socket.io.
